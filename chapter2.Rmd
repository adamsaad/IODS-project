week2 <- read_csv("week2.txt")
summary(week2)
#Mean age is 25.51 so rather young. Deep, stra and surf have normal distributions with 2.8-3.2 median.

plot(lm)
#There could be a non-linear relationship between predictor variables
#and an outcome variable and the pattern could show up in this plot if the model doesnâ€™t capture the non-linear relationship. No non-linearity
